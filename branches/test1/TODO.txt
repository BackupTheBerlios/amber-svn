TODO for first public release
-----------------------------

- examples
- finish work on documentation
- sequence diagram (especially for triggers)
- list of supported attributes
- combine <report>.xml and <report>-Design.xml

- nice to have: modify sql statement to reflect grouping given in xml


BUGS:
-----

- if we execute a join query which should normally return two columns with the same name, the
  resulting associative array only contains one of both columns (the first will be overwritten).
  Same Problem: alias with the same name as a column

  See: http://de3.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-fetch-assoc.php
  
  "[...]If two or more columns of the result have the same field names, the last column will take precedence.
  To access the other column(s) of the same name, you either need to access the result with numeric indices
  by using mysql_fetch_row() or add alias names. See the example at the mysql_fetch_array() description
  about aliases.[...]"

- bug in Format():

  the format expression

          @;"Text"
          
  means that a string is displayed if it's not empty/null, otherwise "Text" will be displayed

Important details for inclusion into documentation
--------------------------------------------------
- ctype extension required (--> lexer)
- remember to set locale if your language has special characters
- grouping: atm the sql statement must include corresponding order by clauses
