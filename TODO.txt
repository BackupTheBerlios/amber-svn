TODO for first public release
-----------------------------

- examples
- finish work on documentation
- sequence diagram (especially for triggers)
- list of supported attributes

- nice to have: modify sql statement to reflect grouping given in xml


Important details for inclusion into documentation
--------------------------------------------------
- ctype extension required (--> lexer)
- remember to set locale if your language has special characters
- grouping: atm the sql statement must include corresponding order by clauses
